All you have to do is move the batter and runners to their positions and set the play and the stats will be automatically updated.

You can customize the number of innings and the rules for male/female batting order (line-up can be automatically sorted or have auto-outs added to adhere to these rules)

A stable network connection is required when creating a statkeeper and recommended whenever updating stats.

This app also works for kickball - you can keep and share kickball stats and scores!
